# Day 1

It's 22:53. I've been reading the documentation of the libraries I will be using.

If I were going to classify them by difficulty, I would say Raylib is the easiest, and Box2D and Enet are harder to grasp.

I haven't found a game that uses the three libraries together, so I'm going to use [a raylib network example](https://github.com/raylib-extras/networking_example) to understand how to integrate Raylib and Enet, and [a raylib-box2d example](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d-raylib) to understand how to integrate Raylib and Box2D. I think [Dynamismal](https://codeberg.org/BigStackOfHay/dynamismal) may also serve as learning material, as it uses Raylib and Box2D.

The first thing I want to do is to create a file client.c for the client, server.c for the server and a common header, maybe bonk.h, and a meson.build file, as I will use Meson as the build system.

But, right now, I think I'm going to sleep.
